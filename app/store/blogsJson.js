The company had a rapid decline of 74%, which gave away the brand’s terrifically financial situation. then why micromax failed.  Micromax has stable to maintain its position. Like no other companies, the Chinese market has captured the interest of the Indian market consumers. The sales of Micromax were impacted by the entry of Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Oppo. However, these are categories can be used to group the elements that have the most negative impact on the brand.

We all choose online platform to buy products because its provide benefits to return and replace policy.

One item that I overlook is the profit margin and commission that were charged. Oppo and Vivo are dominant in the offline sector. As they were paying retailers and distributors more money to keep their brands in front of shoppers. While a brand like Samsung insists that retailers sell phones worth a specific amount, Chinese brands allow retailers to make easy money by displaying the number of units sold.  It is very challenging in a market where cheap phones are the norm."
